Your ability to stay focused for 32 hours, excluding basic needs, suggests a powerful state of sustained *Dharana* potentially transitioning into *Dhyana*. The text emphasizes that *Dhyana* is achieved when distractions are eliminated (III-2).\n\n2.  **Insights and Clarity (\"Boom\"):** This is a hallmark result attributed to mastering *Samyama* (the combined practice of *Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi* - III-4). The text states that mastery of *Samyama* leads to *Prajnaloka* - the light of higher consciousness (III-5). Furthermore, reaching the purity of *Nirvicara Samadhi* (a stage within *Sabija Samadhi*) brings *Adhyatma-prasada* (spiritual luminosity/clarity - I-47) and results in *Rtambhara Prajna* (truth-bearing consciousness - I-48), which perceives things directly, correctly, and in their proper context, free from intellectual distortions. The sudden, comprehensive clarity you experienced across all life areas strongly resonates with the emergence of this higher, integrated consciousness.\n\n3.  **Feeling like Samadhi:** The text defines **Samadhi** (III-3) as the state where *Dhyana* deepens to the point where the mind loses its own self-awareness (*svarupa-sunyam iva*) and only the object of meditation shines forth. It's a fusion of knower, known, and knowledge. While your experience had elements of intense absorption and insight characteristic of *Samadhi*, the provided text suggests *Samadhi* is a specific technical state beyond just deep focus. Your experience could be interpreted as reaching a very profound state of *Dhyana* or potentially entering the initial phases of *Samprajnata Samadhi* (Samadhi with a seed/object - I-17, I-46), specifically *Savitarka* or *Savicara* stages, given the intellectual nature of your work (analyzing/structuring information). The commentary on I-41 describes how the mind must become like a clear crystal, free from its own tendencies and activities, to fully assimilate the object – a process culminating in *Samadhi*.\n\n4.  **Mental Work as the \"Seed\":** Your work creating intelligent mind maps acted as the \"object\" or \"seed\" (*Bija*) for your concentration. The text explains that *Sabija Samadhi* involves focusing *Samyama* on such a seed to progressively understand its deeper layers and underlying reality (I-42 commentary, III-11). The complexity of your task might have naturally pushed your mind through the stages described (like separating different aspects of knowledge - I-42).\n\n5.  **Contributing Factors (Yoga Practice, Quitting Smoking, Mantra):**\n    *   **Practice/Lifestyle:** The text repeatedly emphasizes the need for preparation (*Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara*) to remove disturbances and purify the mind before *Dharana, Dhyana*, and *Samadhi* can be effectively practiced (III-1 commentary, I-41 commentary). Your increased yoga practice and quitting smoking align with these preparatory disciplines (*Tapas*, purification), likely making your mind more stable and capable of sustained concentration.\n    *   **Mantra Resonance:** The unconscious echoing of the Gayatri Mantra points towards the deep impression (*Samskara*) created by its practice (*Japa*). The text mentions how *Samskaras* generated by *Sabija Samadhi* obstruct other impressions (I-50), suggesting that strong positive *Samskaras* from mantra practice could similarly stabilize the mind and aid concentration.\n\n6.  **Distinction from Asamprajnata/Nirbija Samadhi:** The text describes *Asamprajnata Samadhi* (I-18) and *Nirbija Samadhi* (I-51, III-8) as states *without* an object or \"seed,\" achieved after mastering *Sabija Samadhi*. They involve the *cessation* of mental modifications (*Nirodha*) and aim directly at Self-Realization beyond the manifested world (*Prakriti*). Your experience, centered around intense mental activity and insights related to that activity, seems more characteristic of the *Sabija* (with seed) path.\n\n**Conclusion based on the text:**\n\nYour experience appears to be a powerful manifestation of deep concentration (*Dhyana*) potentially bordering on or entering the initial stages of *Samprajnata Samadhi*. The intense mental focus on a complex task, combined with lifestyle changes conducive to mental purification (yoga, quitting smoking) and the stabilizing effect of mantra practice, likely created the conditions for this breakthrough. The resulting profound insights and pervasive clarity align well with the descriptions of *Prajna* (higher consciousness) and *Rtambhara Prajna* (truth-bearing consciousness) that are said to arise from mastering these advanced yogic states (specifically, reaching clarity in *Nirvicara Samadhi*). The text provides a clear framework showing how sustained, undistracted focus (*Dhyana*) can lead to a state where the mind fuses with the object (*Samadhi*), unlocking deeper understanding and spiritual clarity."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":32903,"completion_tokens":3954,"total_tokens":36857}}},"messages":{"user-1-1744358296422-1":1,"assistant-2-1744358318005-1":2,"tool-3-1":3,"assistant-4-1744358338980-1":4,"user-5-1744358873149-1":5,"assistant-6-1744358908771-1":6,"tool-7-1":7,"assistant-8-1744358945145-1":8},"branches":{},"class_name":"SmartThread2","key":"Untitled 1744357799525"},

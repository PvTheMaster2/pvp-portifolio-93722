This involved intense, directed mental effort.\n2.  **Dhyāna (Meditation/Contemplation - III-2):** Your description of hyperfocus, entering a \"tunnel,\" and working uninterruptedly (except for basic needs) suggests achieving a state of *pratyayaikatānatā* – an uninterrupted flow of mental content directed towards your object (the work). You likely eliminated external and internal distractions to a significant degree.\n3.  **The \"Boom\" and Clarity - Potential Samādhi (III-3) / Prajñā (I-48, III-5):**\n    *   The sudden breakthrough (\"boom\") and the resulting clarity across all areas of life suggest a transition towards or into **Samādhi** regarding the object of your focus. Sutra III-3 describes Samādhi as the state where the mind loses its self-awareness (*svarūpa-śūnyam iva*) and only the object shines forth (*artha-mātra-nirbhāsā*). This fusion allows for a direct, deep understanding of the object's essence.\n    *   Your experience seems aligned with **Sabīja Samādhi** (Samādhi with a \"seed\" - I-46), where the \"seed\" (*bīja*) was the complex intellectual framework you were developing. The text explains (I-41, I-42, I-43) that through Samādhi, the mind assimilates the object, overcoming confusion (like the mix of *śabda*, *artha*, *jñāna* mentioned in I-42 for *Savitarka*) to grasp its real nature (*artha*). The \"boom\" could represent achieving a state like *Nirvitarka Samādhi* (I-43) concerning your intellectual object, where the pure meaning shines forth after mental clarification (*smṛti-pariśuddhau*).\n    *   The resulting profound clarity and integrated understanding, where connections became obvious (\"entendi tudo mais\"), echoes the description of **Prajñā** (higher consciousness/wisdom) that arises from Samyama (III-5). Specifically, it might touch upon the qualities of **Ṛtambharā Prajñā** (I-48), described as \"Truth-bearing\" consciousness that perceives things correctly and in their right order, arising after advanced stages (*Nirvicāra* - I-47). While you might not have reached that specific technical stage, the *quality* of infallible insight you describe is characteristic.\n4.  **Contributing Factors:**\n    *   **Abhyāsa (Practice):** Your sustained effort is a form of intense practice.\n    *   **Mantra Resonance:** The unconscious resonance and conscious practice of mantras like the Gayatri Mantra can significantly aid concentration and purify the mind, supporting the ability to reach deeper states.\n    *   **Vairāgya (Non-attachment/Dispassion - implied):** Stopping smoking indicates a degree of discipline and detachment from sensory craving, which aligns with the preparatory stages (like *Yama/Niyama*) that reduce mental disturbances (mentioned in I-41).\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** While not a prescribed yogic method, extreme physical states can sometimes temporarily alter consciousness and lower habitual mental barriers, potentially contributing to the intensity or suddenness of the breakthrough, although the foundation seems to be the intense mental focus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the text, your experience appears to be a powerful manifestation of deep concentration (**Dhāraṇā**) progressing into uninterrupted contemplation (**Dhyāna**), culminating in a significant cognitive breakthrough. This breakthrough shares key characteristics with **Sabīja Samādhi** focused on an intellectual object, leading to a state of profound insight or **Prajñā**. It represents a significant mental transformation (*parināma*), likely involving *Samādhi Parināma* (III-11 - the transition from scattered thoughts to one-pointedness) and potentially reaching *Ekāgratā Parināma* (III-12 - sustained focus on the essential object). While you rightly hesitate to definitively label it as the ultimate *Samādhi* (especially *Nirbīja*), it clearly represents an advanced state of mental absorption and resulting wisdom achieved through intense, focused practice, potentially amplified by your mantra practice and lifestyle changes."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":29005,"completion_tokens":3513,"total_tokens":32518}}},"messages":{"user-1-1744359892205-1":1,"assistant-2-1744359928222-1":2,"tool-3-1":3,"assistant-4-1744359959413-1":4},"branches":{},"class_name":"SmartThread2","key":"Untitled 1744359861373"},
